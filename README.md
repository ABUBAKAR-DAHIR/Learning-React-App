# 🧠 Learning React App

Welcome to my **Learning React App** — a simple yet complete project built to solidify my understanding of **ReactJS fundamentals**.

This project is not a portfolio or production-ready app. Instead, it’s a sandbox where I explored key React concepts like components, props, state, conditional rendering, and responsive design using modern tools like **Vite** and **Netlify**.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to **practice and demonstrate my understanding** of:

- How to set up a React project from scratch using **Vite**
- Creating reusable components
- Managing data using **props** and **useState**
- Styling components using **CSS Flexbox**
- Building a mobile-responsive layout
- Hosting and deploying a project with **Netlify**

It acts as a hands-on notebook for my React learning journey.
